# People Matters

I was so interested in write someting that's eternal and ellegant then keep it in some undestroyable castle of data like the Github server database so I'm gonna be somehow sealed in the human legacy.

So many things I tried to make writing easier, cooler or more interesting, like using Zola, the high-efficiency blog frame, neovim-theme, the coolest blog theme ever, I even listened carefully to the writing class in the university, but none of those pushed significant increase of my willing of writing, or let's say developing this blog.

Then it comes out, the math is there, the truth is there, the only reason I should write is not to invent some new truth in this ellegant world (Otherwise I'll make video games), but rather for the people who may wants to read, get understanded or saved, that was what language made for, luckily I didn't forgot it in the end, and here I am to write it up, or even better: We the people are together to build it, in the god we trust.

Or let's say: In the math we trust.
