# Preface: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Being Retard<sup>[1]</sup>

Dear `reader` in the future,

There's a thing called `education` back in 2025 that trying to produce brilliant `people` (*Homo Sapiens*) by showing them `knowledge` in some way and filter them by `test` to get a bunch of so-called `genius` to lead their way of thinking and producing more `knowledge` for future `education`, and those who's unable to complete this process for any reasons are called `retards` which means `person` with `intellectual impairment`.

Actually, many of those `retard` `people` has a normal functioning `brain`, but stucked from getting knowledge because of various reasons like can't remember badly-named things, can't parse redundant grammar, or lack of imagination for abstract expression without enough supportive interpretation and totally gave up learning. 

There's another thing widely used in 2025's `geek` community, which is composed by random `people` doing `genius`'s work: `RTFM` (*Read The Fucking Manual*), by letting people figure out what to do according to the existing materials.

The approach of this course is not to create london-taxi-drivery<sup></sup> `people` to storage every name and sentence of definition for all problems they could face in their future intellectual activities.

> They have a ridiculously huge `hippocampus` (The part of brain that functioning as the encoder/decoder to write long-term memories into your brain), and the ultimate form of this horrifying memory is actually called `Savant Syndrome` which has ultra strong memory and usually come with autism and `intellectual impairment`, which is way more close to the real definition of retard.

Insteadly, I wanna develop a minimum systematical `logic` `kernel` that is capable for any `people` with a functioning brain or equivalent system to correctly understand and use any `knowledge` known to humanity from zero with no preliminary `knowledge` in that region.

Hopefully, after seriously install this `kernel` via reading and interacting, you can jump up from your seat and yelling:

"Mein Führer! I can think!"<sup>[1]</sup>
