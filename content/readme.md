## Multilingual

Since it's a painful thing to write my every idea in all the languages, which will only block me from writing anything here rather than nextcloud notes, this blog will be freely written in multiple languages, includes English, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish and maybe more, only depends on what language I was thinking for that idea, or whatever matches the situation, so mathematical formula and programming language is also possible to show up.

## Highlight

Just a simple experiment to see if human brain will parse those formats for those different types of elements and make reading faster.

`Variable name`

```python
# A piece of code
println("Hello_World")
```
