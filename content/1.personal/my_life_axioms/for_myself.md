# My Life Vectors

As you can think about everything reasonably and it seems everything is already known or be able to reveal to you, it's easy to fall into a partial best solution, that's when you need to use an model of your motivation that's as ellegant as your understanding of the world: basic vectors, every choice you make will be put in this high-dimension (of course, low dimension if you only have a few specific core value) field to be easily evaluated. For me, those vectors are:

Love

Truth

Art

Justice

Fun
